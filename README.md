# FlavorGo App

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application that mimics the functionality of Uber Eats, allowing users to view menus, customize orders, and place online food delivery orders. The app is designed to provide a seamless user experience with a focus on intuitive navigation and robust backend support.

The key difference is that FlavorGo is built for local communities rather than big cities. Users not only fetch their meals but also benefit from features tailored to enhance community connections and support small businesses.

## Features

### Meal Notifications with a Social Twist

- Introduce a map view where users can discover food trucks, pop-up vendors, or ongoing deals in their area.

### Cultural Recipe Exchange
- Allow users or chefs to share recipes of popular dishes available in the app to connect communities through cooking.
